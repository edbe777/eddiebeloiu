A comprehensive analysis of the Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI). Zoomed in on Heart Disease 2010-2017

The objective is to explore the CDI dataset and interpret the Heart Failure trends via Machine Learning models to find the states with the most Heart Failure Deaths.

# Questions:

What is the most common disease in the USA?

What are the factors affecting the top disease?

Does a disease respect borders? In other words, is a disease limited by state borders?

How does a disease change over time?
