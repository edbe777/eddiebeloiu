Linkedin Posts Analysis Project Personal Project

This is a simple program to show how many likes, comments, and views a LinkedIn profile has. I used my perdonal LinkedIn profile for testing, and the results are accurate. This program can be used to improve the posts, and/or to see the data visually. 


Steps:

1.Make sure you have the correct chrome driver for the program to run properly 

-download chrome driver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads){:target="_blank"} 


2.Run the program. 

-program will ask for the LinkedIn credentials, profile and the number of posts you wish to analyze 


-the program will scrape the likes, comments and views for the posts 


-the program will output graphs of the likes, comments and views as image files and csv files in the same folder
