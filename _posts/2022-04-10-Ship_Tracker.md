Ship Tracking Project


This is a project to track the movements of a ship and plot them on a map in Python using the folium and Geocoder Libraries.

I scraped the ship GPS position data from the myshiptracking.com website, 
and I looked at the vessel HMM DUBLIN with the IMO: 9863314 and the MMSI:356429000 for testing and educational purposes.

Steps: 
You need to install [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases){:target="_blank"} 
Run the program
Output of the program will be the second map (with pins) saved in the same folder as the python program.
